## installation

There are different ways of installing `msu`.

1. The preferred way is to use the **OFFICIAL RELEASE**. Download
   the latest tarball at https://github.com/GochoMugo/msu/releases/latest:

    ```bash
    $ tar xvf msu-x.x.x.tar.gz
    $ cd msu-x.x.x/
    $ ./install.sh
    ```

1. **Manual installing** by cloning this repo and running the
   `install.sh` script.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/GochoMugo/msu.git
    $ cd msu/
    $ ./install.sh
    ```

   This method is preferable if you will be contributing to the 
   project. Note that this uses the master branch, possibly with
   unreleased changes. Also, the manpages are **not** installed.

See further [installation instructions][installation].


## documentation

You can browse msu documentation from your terminal using `man`:

```bash
$ man 1 msu       # command
$ man 3 msu       # library
```

A guide for [contributing to msu][contributing] is also available.


## project principles

1. **Little added complexity.** `msu` should **not** warrant the user to learn scripting all over again. An existing script should be converted into a module with less effort.
1. **Minimal**. `msu` core should be as little as possible. How? Use common algorithms and data structures. Avoid doing something too fancy.
1. **Highly configurable**. Using environment variables and command-line switches, `msu` should be configurable in all its operations, including installation.
