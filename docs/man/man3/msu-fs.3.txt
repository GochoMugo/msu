NAME
----
msu-fs - Functions for manipulating the file-system, usually common operations


SYNOPSIS
--------
This module contains common tasks.

    msu_require "fs"


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*append('PATH', 'CONTENT')*::
    Appends the content 'CONTENT' to the file at path 'PATH'. It resolves
    symbolic links.

*joindirs('DEST_DIR', 'DIR'...)*::
    Joins the source directories 'DIR'... into destination directory
    at the path 'DEST_DIR'. The directories are merged resulting in one
    directory with all the contents from the source directories.

    Alias: fs.join

*trash(['PATH']...)*::
    Removes files (and directories) at paths 'PATH'.... These files, being
    placed in /tmp can be salvaged later using the 'untrash' function.
    However, the files will usually be removed on system startup when the
    /tmp directory is emptied.

    Alias: fs.trash

*untrash(['PATH']...)*::
    Reverses trashing of files (and directories) that were originally
    trashed using the 'trash' function.

    Alias: fs.untrash
