DESCRIPTION
-----------

The msu(1) command adds useful utilities for use in your shell.
*msu* stands for 'My' 'Shell' 'Utilities'.


COMMANDS
--------

*h, help*

   > Shows basic help information, shortened for easier recap.

*i, install* 'MODULE'...

   > Installs the module 'MODULE' into the directory at
   > `${MSU_EXTERNAL_LIB}`. The module can be located either locally
   > or remotely.
   
   > If remote, a prefix shorthand is required to determine where to
   > fetch the module from. Available case-insensitive shorthands
   > include:

      bt: - from Bitbucket, using HTTPS e.g. 'bt:myusername/myrepo'
      bts: - from Bitbucket, using SSH e.g. 'bts:myusername/myrepo'
      gh: - from Github, using HTTPS e.g. 'gh:myusername/myrepo'
      ghs: - from Github, using SSH e.g. 'ghs:myusername/myrepo'
      gl: - for GitLab, using HTTPS e.g. 'gl:myusername/myrepo'
      gls: - for GitLab, using SSH e.g. 'gls:myusername/myrepo'

   > If the remote repository is private, SSH should be used
   > instead. This allows avoiding being prompted for password and
   > the request being rejected in cases where 2FA is enabled.

   > You can specify a version, using a git tag. For example,
   > 'gh:myusername/myrepo#v0.0.0' would fetch the remote module
   > at version 'v0.0.0', provided the git tag ('v0.0.0'; exactly
   > as specified) exists.

*im, install-many* 'PATH'

   > Installs modules listed in a file at path 'PATH'. Each line
   > of the file is assumed to be a single module and is eventually
   > passed to the *install* sub-command. This is useful when
   > bootstrapping machines.

*ls, list*

   > Lists the external modules you have installed.

*nk, nuke*

   > Uninstalls msu entirely from the machine. This involves
   > removing the msu executable, internal and external modules,
   > load strings added to ~/.bashrc and manpages.

*r, run* 'MODULE'.'FUNC'

   > Runs the function 'FUNC' in the module 'MODULE'. Any extra
   > arguments are passed to the function as is.

   > For example,

        $ msu run console.success 'a success message'

*re, require* 'MODULE'...

   > Loads the module 'MODULE' into a new bash environment,
   > making the modules' functions and variables available.
   > Usually, this environment should 'sourced' into the current
   > environment.

   > For example,

        $ . msu require console
        $ success 'a success message'

*u, uninstall* 'MODULE'...

   > Uninstalls the module 'MODULE' by removing its contents from
   > `${MSU_EXTERNAL_LIB}`.

*um, uninstall-many* 'PATH'

   > Uninstalls modules listed in a file at path 'PATH'. Each line
   > of the file is assumed to be a single module and is eventually
   > passed to the *uninstall* sub-command. This is useful in
   > un-bootstrapping machines (as a reverse of *install-many*).

*up, upgrade* ['VERSION']

   > Upgrades msu to the version 'VERSION', if passed. Otherwise
   > upgrades to the latest version. This request may hit the
   > network to check for new versions and execute downloads if
   > necessary.

*v, version* ['MODULE']

   > Shows version information for the module 'MODULE', if passed.
   > Otherwise, shows version information for msu itself.

*x, execute* 'PATH'

   > Executes the file at path 'PATH' by simply running the code
   > through bash, with the core library loaded before-hand. This
   > emulates the action of running a function with its body being
   > the contents of the file. This command should be considered
   > DANGEROUS as it is able to execute commands in a file without 
   > the execution bit set.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

*`${MSU_EXTERNAL_LIB}`*

   > Set to the path to the directory holding the external modules.
   > It is where modules are installed to, with the *install* 
   > and *install-many* sub-commands. It defaults to
   > `${HOME}/.msu`.


ALIASES
-------

On startup, aliases are loaded. Aliases added by msu are prefixed
with 'msu'. Remember any alias (including those added by msu itself)
can be overridden. See msu(3) for more details on how aliases work.

One of the most important aliases is *msu.reload*.

*msu.reload*

   > Reloads aliases from internal and external modules. This
   > allows you to load new aliases after installing modules.

Other aliases are listed in man(3).


SHEBANG
-------

msu can be used in a shebang line, which in almost all cases would
be '#!/usr/bin/env msu'. The shell script (using the shebang),
would receive the path to itself as `${1}` and have the other
arguments follow as normal, in `${2}`, `${3}`, ... This means
that the script can accept command-line arguments.


CAVEATS
-------

The commands *install*, *install-many* and *upgrade* use git for
cloning repositories and generating module metadata. Therefore, the
command git(1) must be available.
